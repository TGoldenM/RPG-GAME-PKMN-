CRON 1.4 information

To schedule your scripts to run on a periodic basis, add the scripts to 
your application's .openshift/cron/{minutely,hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}/
directories (and commit and redeploy your application).

Example: A script .openshift/cron/hourly/crony added to your application
         will be executed once every hour.
         Similarly, a script .openshift/cron/weekly/chronograph added
         to your application will be executed once every week.
